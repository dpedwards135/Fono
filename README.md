## FONO

FONO is an events search application, designed to find things for the user to do, before the user even thinks to look.

## Motivation

David Edwards, the creator of this project, developed it because of the lack of a simple way to connect at a moment's notice with the community around him. The other applications were cumbersome and focused only on massive events, rather than the myriad of interesting local happenings that go on all the time.

## Download

You can download FONO on the Google Play Store.
